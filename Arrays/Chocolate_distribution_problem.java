/*
 You are given an array where each element represents the number of chocolates in a packet, and m students.
The goal is to distribute exactly one packet to each student such that the difference between the maximum and minimum 
chocolates among selected packets is minimum.

   m = 7
   Expected Output: 10
   Explanation: Choose packets [40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 48, 50]; difference = 50 - 40 = 10.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Input:
   packets = [1, 3, 4, 7, 9, 9, 12, 56]
   m = 5
   Expected Output: 8
   Explanation: Choose packets [3, 4, 7, 9, 9]; difference = 9 - 3 = 6 (best possible).

5Ô∏è‚É£ Input:
   packets = [5, 8, 12, 18, 22, 30]
   m = 3
   Expected Output: 10
   Explanation: Choose packets [12, 18, 22]; difference = 22 - 12 = 10.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Input:
   packets = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
   m = 2
   Expected Output: 1
   Explanation: Choose [1, 2] or [2, 3] etc. Minimum difference = 1.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Input:
   packets = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
   m = 4
   Expected Output: 30
   Explanation: Choose [10, 20, 30, 40]; difference = 30.

8Ô∏è‚É£ Input:
   packets = [10, 10, 10, 10]
   m = 2
   Expected Output: 0
   Explanation: All packets have equal chocolates, difference = 0.

9Ô∏è‚É£ Input:
   packets = [4, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 22, 25]
   m = 3
   Expected Output: 4
   Explanation: Choose [8, 10, 12]; difference = 12 - 8 = 4.

üîü Input:
   packets = [5, 1, 9, 3, 7, 11, 13]
   m = 4
   Expected Output: 6
   Explanation: Choose [5, 7, 9, 11]; difference = 11 - 5 = 6.

11Ô∏è‚É£ Input:
   packets = [1]
   m = 1
   Expected Output: 0
   Explanation: Only one student, so difference = 0.

12Ô∏è‚É£ Input:
   packets = [1, 2, 3]
   m = 5
   Expected Output: -1
   Explanation: Not enough packets to distribute.

13Ô∏è‚É£ Input:
   packets = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
   m = 3
   Expected Output: 0
   Explanation: All packets have same chocolates, difference = 0.

14Ô∏è‚É£ Input:
   packets = [20, 15, 10, 5]
   m = 2
   Expected Output: 5
   Explanation: Choose [10, 15]; difference = 5.

15Ô∏è‚É£ Input:
   packets = [8, 6, 4, 3, 1]
   m = 3
   Expected Output: 3
   Explanation: Choose [3, 4, 6]; difference = 6 - 3 = 3.
