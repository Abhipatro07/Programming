/*
Test Cases for count_frequency_without_extra_space:

1. Input: arr = [2, 3, 3, 2, 5]
   Expected Output: 2 occurs 2 times, 3 occurs 2 times, 5 occurs 1 time
   Explanation: Counts frequency of each element without using extra space.

2. Input: arr = [1, 1, 1, 1]
   Expected Output: 1 occurs 4 times
   Explanation: Single unique element repeated.

3. Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   Expected Output: 1 occurs 1 time, 2 occurs 1 time, 3 occurs 1 time, 4 occurs 1 time, 5 occurs 1 time
   Explanation: All elements unique.

4. Input: arr = [4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
   Expected Output: 4 occurs 5 times
   Explanation: All elements same.

5. Input: arr = [1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3]
   Expected Output: 1 occurs 3 times, 2 occurs 2 times, 3 occurs 1 time
   Explanation: Mix of repeated and unique elements.

6. Input: arr = [0, 0, 0]
   Expected Output: 0 occurs 3 times
   Explanation: All zeros.

7. Input: arr = [5]
   Expected Output: 5 occurs 1 time
   Explanation: Single element array.

8. Input: arr = []
   Expected Output: No elements
   Explanation: Empty array â†’ no frequency to count.

9. Input: arr = [2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3]
   Expected Output: 2 occurs 3 times, 3 occurs 3 times
   Explanation: Two elements alternating.

10. Input: arr = [7, 8, 7, 9, 7, 8]
    Expected Output: 7 occurs 3 times, 8 occurs 2 times, 9 occurs 1 time
    Explanation: Counts all element frequencies.
