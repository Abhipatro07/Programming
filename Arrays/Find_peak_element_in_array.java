Test Cases for Find_peak_element_in_array:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Input: [1, 2, 3, 1]
    Expected Output: 3
    Explanation: 3 is greater than both 2 (left) and 1 (right).

2Ô∏è‚É£ Input: [1, 2, 1, 3, 5, 6, 4]
    Expected Output: 6
    Explanation: 6 > 5 and 4 (a valid peak), 2 and 5 are also possible peaks but 6 is one of them.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Input: [10, 20, 15, 2, 23, 90, 67]
    Expected Output: 20 or 90
    Explanation: Both 20 > 10 & 15, and 90 > 23 & 67 are peaks.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Input: [5, 10, 20, 15]
    Expected Output: 20
    Explanation: 20 > 10 and 15.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Input: [10, 20, 15, 2, 23, 90, 67, 100]
    Expected Output: 100
    Explanation: The last element 100 is greater than 67 (only one neighbor).

6Ô∏è‚É£ Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    Expected Output: 5
    Explanation: Strictly increasing ‚Äî last element is peak.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Input: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
    Expected Output: 5
    Explanation: Strictly decreasing ‚Äî first element is peak.

8Ô∏è‚É£ Input: [2, 2, 2, 2]
    Expected Output: 2
    Explanation: All elements are equal, any can be considered a peak.

9Ô∏è‚É£ Input: [1]
    Expected Output: 1
    Explanation: Single element array ‚Äî only one peak.

üîü Input: [3, 5, 3, 5, 3]
    Expected Output: 5 (either of them)
    Explanation: Both 5s are valid peaks.

11Ô∏è‚É£ Input: [0, 10, 5, 8, 7]
    Expected Output: 10 or 8
    Explanation: 10 > 0,5 and 8 > 5,7 both are valid peaks.

12Ô∏è‚É£ Input: [4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4]
    Expected Output: 4
    Explanation: Multiple peaks (4s at even indices).

13Ô∏è‚É£ Input: [1, 3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 4]
    Expected Output: 3 or 5
    Explanation: Both 3 and 5 satisfy the peak condition.

14Ô∏è‚É£ Input: [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 3, 2]
    Expected Output: 6 or 3
    Explanation: 6 (first element) and 3 (local maximum) are peaks.

15Ô∏è‚É£ Input: [2, 7, 7, 7, 5]
    Expected Output: 7
    Explanation: Flat plateau of 7s ‚Äî any of them can be a peak.
