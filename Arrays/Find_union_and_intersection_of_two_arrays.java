   Expected Union: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
   Expected Intersection: [3, 4, 5]
   Explanation: Common elements are 3, 4, 5; all unique elements combined for union.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Input:
   arr1 = [10, 20, 30]
   arr2 = [40, 50, 60]
   Expected Union: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
   Expected Intersection: []
   Explanation: No common elements between arrays.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Input:
   arr1 = [1, 1, 1, 1]
   arr2 = [1, 1, 1, 1]
   Expected Union: [1]
   Expected Intersection: [1]
   Explanation: Both arrays have only one unique value ‚Äî 1.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Input:
   arr1 = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]
   arr2 = [15, 20, 25, 30, 35]
   Expected Union: [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35]
   Expected Intersection: [15, 20, 25]
   Explanation: Common values are 15, 20, 25.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Input:
   arr1 = [0, 0, 1, 2]
   arr2 = [2, 2, 3, 4]
   Expected Union: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
   Expected Intersection: [2]
   Explanation: Only 2 is common, rest are unique.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Input:
   arr1 = [7, 8, 9]
   arr2 = []
   Expected Union: [7, 8, 9]
   Expected Intersection: []
   Explanation: Second array empty, union = first array, intersection = empty.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Input:
   arr1 = []
   arr2 = [1, 2, 3]
   Expected Union: [1, 2, 3]
   Expected Intersection: []
   Explanation: First array empty, union = second array.

8Ô∏è‚É£ Input:
   arr1 = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
   arr2 = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
   Expected Union: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
   Expected Intersection: []
   Explanation: No overlapping numbers.

9Ô∏è‚É£ Input:
   arr1 = [4, 5, 6, 7]
   arr2 = [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
   Expected Union: [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
   Expected Intersection: [5, 6, 7]
   Explanation: Common numbers are 5, 6, 7.

üîü Input:
   arr1 = [2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4]
   arr2 = [3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6]
   Expected Union: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
   Expected Intersection: [3, 4]
   Explanation: Duplicates ignored, common are 3 and 4.

11Ô∏è‚É£ Input:
   arr1 = [-3, -2, -1, 0]
   arr2 = [-1, 0, 1, 2, 3]
   Expected Union: [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3]
   Expected Intersection: [-1, 0]
   Explanation: Common negative and zero values included.

12Ô∏è‚É£ Input:
   arr1 = [100, 200, 300]
   arr2 = [100, 100, 200, 400]
   Expected Union: [100, 200, 300, 400]
   Expected Intersection: [100, 200]
   Explanation: Both arrays share 100 and 200.
