Test Cases for find_missing_number_in_array_1_to_n:

1. Input: [1, 2, 3, 5], n = 5
   Expected Output: 4
   Explanation: Numbers are from 1 to 5, but 4 is missing.

2. Input: [2, 3, 1, 5], n = 5
   Expected Output: 4
   Explanation: Only 4 is missing.

3. Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], n = 10
   Expected Output: 5
   Explanation: 5 is not present in the array.

4. Input: [2], n = 2
   Expected Output: 1
   Explanation: 1 is missing.

5. Input: [1], n = 2
   Expected Output: 2
   Explanation: 2 is missing.

6. Input: [1, 3], n = 3
   Expected Output: 2
   Explanation: 2 is missing.

7. Input: [2, 4, 1, 5, 6], n = 6
   Expected Output: 3
   Explanation: 3 is missing.

8. Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10], n = 10
   Expected Output: 8
   Explanation: 8 is missing.

9. Edge Case: Input: [1], n = 1
   Expected Output: No missing number (but usually this case wonâ€™t occur, since problem assumes 1 number missing).

10. Edge Case: Empty Array []
    n = 1
    Expected Output: 1
    Explanation: The only number 1 is missing.
